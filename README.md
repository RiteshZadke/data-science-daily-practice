# Data Science Daily Practice

This repository contains my daily practice for building strong
foundations in Python, SQL, and core Data Science concepts.

The focus is on **consistency, clarity, and correct fundamentals**
rather than random or rushed learning.

## Repository Structure

- `01_python_daily/`  
  Daily Python practice notebooks (10 questions per day), following
  a structured learning sequence from basics to advanced topics.

- `02_sql_daily/`  
  Daily SQL practice files covering querying, filtering, aggregation,
  joins, and analytical queries.

- `03_feature_engineering/`  
  End-to-end feature engineering practice on multiple datasets.

- `04_machine_learning/`  
  Classical machine learning algorithms with proper preprocessing,
  evaluation, and model interpretation.

- `05_deep_learning/`  
  Neural network fundamentals, ANN/CNN models, and hands-on practice
  using modern deep learning frameworks.

- `06_nlp/`  
  Natural Language Processing concepts including text preprocessing,
  vectorization, and basic NLP models.

- `07_gen_ai/`  
  Practice with Generative AI concepts such as prompt engineering,
  large language models, and retrieval-based applications.

## Practice Approach

- One core topic per day
- Small, focused practice sessions
- Clean and readable code
- Emphasis on understanding logic, assumptions, and edge cases
- Regular commits to track progress over time

## Goal

To develop strong, interview-ready fundamentals across the data science
stack and maintain a disciplined daily practice habit.
